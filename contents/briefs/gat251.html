            For my 2D Game Design II module, as misleading as the name is, we were tasked to design a 3D game of
            our own choosing. The module taught us how to create a fantasy for player immersion and how to utilise
            design techniques to capture and guide the player's attention as they progress in the game. It acted as
            my proper introduction into 3D game design. For this project, I used Unreal Engine to create my game,
            and I was able to dabble into:
