      For my 2D Game Design II module, as misleading as the name is, we were tasked to design a 3D game of
      our own choosing. The module taught us how to create a fantasy for player immersion and how to utilise
      design techniques to capture and guide the player's attention as they progress in the game. It acted as

    </ul>
