            For this module, we formed pair teams and were tasked to design a 3D multi-player game using Unreal
            Tornament. For this project, we could fully focus on the level design and maximising player engagement
            with pre-established mechanics. I was also exposed the some of the design considerations when it came
            to multiplayer games.

            implemented in the write-up I make.</i>
