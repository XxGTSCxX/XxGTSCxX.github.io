            For one of my design electives, I took the User Experience module and from there learnt the basics
            in UI/UX Design, including different fidelities of wireframes, basic colour theory, spacing and
            alignment, etc. And for our final project, we get to design and implement a prototype for a hypothetical
            game, Chain of Jewels. I had the opportunity to try my hand on implementing things like:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes       </li>
            <li>Photobashing Mockups          </li>
            <li>Prototyping Layouts with Unity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <i>Write-up is still a work in progress. I will be sharing some examples of the things I've
            implemented in the write-up I make.</i>
