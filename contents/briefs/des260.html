      For one of my design electives, I took the User Experience module and from there learnt the basics
      in UI/UX Design, including different fidelities of wireframes, basic colour theory, spacing and
      alignment, etc. And for our final project, we get to design and implement a prototype for a hypothetical
      game, Chain of Jewels. I had the opportunity to try my hand on implementing things like:

    <ul>
      <li>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes       </li>
      <li>Photobashing Mockups          </li>
      <li>Prototyping Layouts with Unity</li>
    </ul>
