            The <a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/Chilldew">Chilldew project</a> is a personal game engine and
            editor project that I'm currently working on. It is the cumulation of all the things I have learnt in my
            time at Digipen and the project I use to test any programming concepts that I am curious about, such as
            data oriented programming.

            I'm currently also looking into <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> as a start to continuous
            integration and deployment. I'm hoping to implement that into my Chilldew project once I have a better
            understanding on how to set it up. I'm currently using a
            <a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/travis-ci-cpp-example">forked project</a> to better understand the
            tool.
