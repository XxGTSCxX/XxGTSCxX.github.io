      <a href="https://games.digipen.edu/games/eos"><b>EOS</b></a> is a 3D puzzle game made by an
      11 person team, Bonsai Tavern, for our 3rd year Digipen games project. I was the producer
      for the first semester before stepping down to fully focus on my technical responsibilities
      in the second semester. Some of the things I've implemented include:
