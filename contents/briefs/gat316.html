            For our GAT316 module, 3D Game Design II, we formed 4 person teams and were tasked to design a 3D
            open world game using Unreal Engine 4. From this, I was exposed the some of the design considerations
            needed compared to linear games and the importance of quality over quantity. Some of the things I
            implemented include:

            <li>Metric Gym                      </li>
            <li>Material Shaders for UI Feedback</li>
            <li>Level Design                    </li>
            <li>Quest Design                    </li>
        </ul>

            <i>Write-up is still a work in progress. I will be sharing some examples of the things I've
            implemented in the write-up I make.</i>
