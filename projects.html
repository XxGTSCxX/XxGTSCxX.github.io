						The <a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/Chilldew">Chilldew project</a> is a game engine and editor
						project that I'm currently working on. It is the cumulation of all the things I have learnt in my
						time at Digipen and the project I use to test any programming concepts that I am curious about,
						such as data oriented programming.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm currently also looking into <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> as a start to
						continuous integration and deployment. I'm hoping to implement that into my Chilldew project
						once I have a better understanding on how to set it up. I'm currently using a
						<a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/travis-ci-cpp-example">forked project</a> to better
						understand the tool.

				<h3>UI/UX Design</h3>

				<h4 class="accordion">DES260: User Experience Design</h4>

				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						For one of my design electives, I took the User Experience module and from there learnt about the
						wireframes, the different levels of fidelity that they could have, mockups, and experienced what
						it's like to quickly iterate and prototypes for these layouts using Unity. You can learn and see
						my work in my write-up here.
