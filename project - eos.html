			<b>EOS</b> is a 3rd year Digipen games project made with our team's custom 3D game engine named "DarkHorse".
			For this project, we used the C++ language and I spent the first semester as the Producer before stepping
			down to fully focus on the technical aspects of the project due to our shortage on programmers. As a
			programmer, I mainly focused on the backend programming, such as:

			<li><a href="#De/Serialiser"        >De/Serialiser        </a></li>

			<li><a href="#Prefab System"        >Prefab System        </a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This project was challenging in more ways than one and was a huge learning experience. For the most part
			there were a lot of misunderstandings on what I could do or what is needed by my fellow programmers. I will
			be discussing what I had implemented versus what I learnt from it and believe how I should have implemented
			things instead.
		</p>

		<h3 id="Property Reflection">Property Reflection</h3>

		<p>
			For our property reflection, we utilised <a href="https://gitlab.com/LIONant/properties">Lionant's
				Properties project</a> to implement our reflection engine. It laid out majority of the ground work and I
			wrapped it in Reflection class such that it would readable C++ format for my fellow programmers to use. What

		</p>

		<h3 id="De/Serialiser">De/Serialiser</h3>

		<p>
			One of the things that took me a really long time to understand was the "automation" of the serialiser and
			deserialiser should have used. Originally, I was under the impression that the Serialiser and Deserialiser
			should specify how each object should be de/serialised. This mistake however, led to a lot of circular
			dependencies in
		</p>

		<h3 id="3D Assets Compiler">3D Assets Compiler</h3>

		<p>
			For our 3D Assets Compiler we made use of the library <a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">Assimp</a>
			to do most of the heavy lifting. It was the hub for the different asset types to be converted into a single
			assimp object which we can then use to convert into our own file format. That way, the engine did not need
			to handle the conversion or reading of each different asset format. After creating the compiler, the editor
			runs the compiler on the selected assets.

		<p>
			This was by far one of the most difficult part of the project that I had to deal with since it involved the
			very thing I was bad at - math.
		</p>

		<h3 id="Configuration Manager">Configuration Manager</h3>

		<p>
			The configuration manager acted as the manager for all "settings" files. I have come to regret the design
			decision that I went with since it was not the most refined and was born out of my ignorance to what the
			reflection system could have (should have) accomplished.
		</p>

		<p>
			The design for the configuration manager was something that we thought could go two ways:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Type free version that uses a <code>std::variant</code> to serialise and deserialise the supported
				types so that the de/serialisation would be consistent across all config types.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inheritance version, where all configs inherit from a base config class and have a virtual
				function that can be used to serialise and deserialise itself.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The first option gave a clean means to serialisation and deserialisation as any other user could create a
			config without worrying about how they should de/serialise them. The second provided type safety, ensuring
			the users that the data they required would exist.
		</p>

		<p>
			Naturally, properly utilising the reflection system would have given us the best of both worlds as it
			would have guarenteed both, however, since this was made before I properly understood and designed the
			reflection system, I opted to go with first option.
		</p>

		<p>
			This choice created an inconvenience, as the users will then have to manually initialise their type safe
			classes with syntax such as:
		</p>

		<p><code>ConfigManager::Get().GetConfig("config_name").GetField&lttype_t&gt("field_name")</code></p>

		<p>
			And to be safe, they would have to add many checks, such as:
		</p>

		<pre class="p">
			<code>
			if (ConfigManager::Get().HasConfig("config_name"))
			{
			    auto&& config = ConfigManager::Get().GetConfig("config_name");
			    if (config.HasField&lttype_t&gt("field_name"))
			    {
			        auto&& config.GetField&lttype_t&gt("field_name");
			    }
			}
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			And a simple spelling mistake meant that they would not be able to detect the issue as easily as a compile
			error would catch it (and we all know how painful it is to have to sit through a long compile time before
			realising that there was something wrong with the code when we run it).
