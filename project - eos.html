		<h2>About the Game</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="https://games.digipen.edu/games/eos"><b>EOS</b></a> is a 3D narrative driven puzzle game following
			Eos, a girl who is fulfiling her mother's last wishes, which was to bring her medallion to the top of a
			tower built by Eos' father. As Eos lives in Solaire, a world that is stuck in constant day, she is surprised
			when she realise the medallion her mother gave her allows her to step into Lunaire, a world stuck in constant
			night.
		</p>

		<p>
			The game revolves around duality: day and night, built and ruin, and a portal that acts as the gate between.
			The game uses spacial puzzles that comes from the utilising both worlds to get to your destination as there
			would be obstacles that exists in one world, that don't in the other.
		</p>

		<h2>My Contributions</h2>

		<p>
			For this project, we used the C++ language and I spent the first semester as the producer before stepping
			down to fully focus on the technical aspects of the project due to our shortage on programmers. As a
			programmer, I mainly focused on the backend programming, such as:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="#Property Reflection"  >Property Reflection  </a></li>
			<li><a href="#De/Serialiser"        >De/Serialiser        </a></li>
			<li><a href="#Configuration Manager">Configuration Manager</a></li>
			<li><a href="#3D Animations"        >3D Animations        </a></li>
			<li><a href="#Prefab System"        >Prefab System        </a></li>
			<li><a href="#MISC"                 >Miscellaneous        </a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This project was challenging in more ways than one and was a huge learning experience for the team as none
			of us were experienced on the needs for a game production pipeline and there were a lot of times where we
			made poor design decisions that lacked hindsight. For this write-up, I will be discussing about the mistakes
			I made in my choices and how I rectified or learned from them. Due to Digipen's rules and regulation, we
			aren't allowed share our repositiories so I'll do my best share relavent bits in code snippets.
		</p>

		<p>
			We had a lot of issues as we were used to object-oriented programming and were trying to switch to
			data-oriented programming. Unfortunately, while the attempt was made, we were not successful at doing a full
			switch. This incomplete implementation actually caused caused us even more issues as we ended up with an
			engine that was trying to use conflicting ideologies.
		</p>

		<h3 id="Property Reflection">Property Reflection</h3>

		<p>
			For our property reflection, we utilised <a href="https://gitlab.com/LIONant/properties">LIONant's
				Properties project</a> to implement our reflection engine. It laid out majority of the ground work and I
			wrapped it in Reflection class such that it would be more readable in the C++ format that my fellow
			programmers were more familiar with.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the reflection system, my fellow programmers were able to use the macros to reflect their components and
			scripts. They are also able to find out the inheritance without the use of dynamic casts which can be very
			expensive.
		</p>

		<h4 class="accordion">Display VS Serialised Fields</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				Some of the tags that LIONant lets you add to the variabe you're reflecting include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>property::flags::SHOW_READONLY</code></li>
				<li><code>property::flags::DONTSAVE     </code></li>
				<li><code>property::flags::DONTSHOW     </code></li>
				<li><code>property::flags::DISABLE      </code></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Unfortunately, in my naivety, I did not realise that the difference this provides is the ability for the editor
				and serialiser to identify if the field is meant to be displayed, and/or serialised when saving it to a file, or
				if fields are just to be displayed but not changed.
			</p>

			<p>
				This led to a lot of unnecessary complications with our component initialisation as my fellow programmers had
				the ability to reflect a variable via getter and setter functions. This meant that there was the potential of
				undefined behaviour as some functions might use uninitialised variables. While we could have just removed the
				ability for the programmer to do this, it introduced optimisation issues where additional variables might need
				to be used instead - causing the components to be unnecessarily fattened, or the inability to track if a variable
				is dirty or not.
			</p>

			<p>
				Honestly, I don't think this was an issue that got resolved properly. While we had added an initialisation
				phase to components so that the behaviour of the variables that affected one another could be dealt with there,
				it did not change the fact that reflect getters and setters could not use other variables or components to
				initialise itself. I was just lucky enough that nobody else had reflected getter and setter functions that used
				variables outside of the variable it was initialising so it wasn't as problematic as it could have been.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 id="Reflecting Handles" class="accordion">Reflecting Handles</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				The purpose of handles are serialisable references to objects.
				(<a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/managing-data-relationships">here</a>'s an article discussing its use and why
				we should use them). We use them to reference components, entities and resources. To serialise these objects without
				causing circular dependencies, we created handle bases which we reflect and have the actual handles inherit from
				them for the engine to know what types of object they reference to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's a rough example of the interface and implementation (NOTE: It's not the exact implementation we went with):
			</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="column" style="width: 50.91%">
					<img src="assets/gam300/examples - handle_base.PNG" alt="HandleBase Example">
				</div>

				<div class="column" style="width: 49.09%">
					<img src="assets/gam300/examples - handle.PNG" alt="Handle Example">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				<code>m_type</code> does not need to be serialised as the object itself would always know what is its own type.
				It's there for the engine/editor to know what's the type of the handle without manually accounting for every case
				while also allowing the users to do casting without the need to do a dynamic cast. How this is accomplished is
				through a type manager of sorts (in this case, denoted by <code>Type</code>) that has registered a type identifier
				for each type:
			</p>

			<div class="center-align">
				<img class="medium-width" src="assets/gam300/examples - handle_typecast.PNG" alt="Casting with Handles">
			</div>

			<p>
				However, early on, I did not understand this, and we tried our best to brute force our way to reflect components and
				entity handles. This caused us to be unable to reflect entities and components using the reflection engine as it
				caused a circular dependency. Which in turn caused us to manually define how to reflect our scenes.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the time I had realised the way handles should have been reflected, we were only able to salvage the resource
				handles as things were too inter-mingled on the entity and component handle side. It would have taken me a while to
				implement the refactor (with legacy loading support) and it was unfortunately time that I could not afford. Of
				course, this causes a lot of problems down the road which I will discuss in my Prefabs and De/serialiser sections.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 class="accordion">Reflecting Enums</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				The reflection of enums was something that I implemented much later down the road, but at this point, I had a better
				understanding on how we should utilise base classes and how reflection should work so it was easier to implement. The
				things that were implemented:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>EnumBase                        </code></li>
				<li><code>ReflectedEnumDetails&lttype_t&gt</code></li>
				<li><code>EnumDetails                     </code></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				As mentioned in the <b>Reflecting Handles</b> section, when attempting to reflect a
				templated class, it is best to create a base class that the template inherits from and reflect the base class instead.
				This base class is the <code>EnumBase</code>. However, as inheritance is not possible for enums, this enum base acts
				like more of a proxy.
			</p>

			<p>
				As the enum is also meant to be displayed and serialised as its string counter part, we also needed a means for the
				users to convert back and forth between its name and its value. This is where the
				<code>ReflectedEnumDetails&lttype_t&gt</code> comes in. It is used to store the map of enum names to their values.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, <code>ReflectedEnumDetails&lttype_t&gt</code> is a templated class, and if the users already knew which enum
				type they were dealing with, they would use the type directly. What we created the
				<code>ReflectedEnumDetails&lttype_t&gt</code> for is to enable the <code>EnumBase</code>, who would not know the C++
				type of the enum to do a type cast (unless you manually handle each case to do a cast - but the whole point is to
				automate this, am I right?), to be able to access their respective maps of values without doing an actual type cast.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is where <code>EnumDetails</code> come in. This is the non-templated version of
				<code>ReflectedEnumDetails&lttype_t&gt</code> that stores the function pointers to the functions used to convert the
				strings to the values and vice versa. This object is created and stored into the Reflection system upon application
				instantiation via our <code>DH_REFLECT_ENUM</code> macro which anyone can use to get their information from.
			</p>

			<div class="center-align">
				<img class="medium-width" src="assets/gam300/examples - reflect_enum.PNG" alt="Example of enum reflection"        >
				<img class="small-width"  src="assets/gam300/examples - enum_fields.PNG"  alt="How the editor display enum fields">
			</div>

			<p class="center-align"><i>Example use of enum reflection.</i></p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="De/Serialiser">De/Serialiser</h3>

		<p>
			One of the things that took me a really long time to understand was the "automation" of the serialiser and
			deserialiser should have used. Originally, I was under the impression that the Serialiser and Deserialiser
			should specify how each object should be de/serialised. This mistake however, led to a lot of circular
			dependencies in the headers especially when templated types were concerned.
		</p>

		<p>
			The reason the type needed to be known instead of keeping the reflection purely data based was because of how
			the editor needed a way to know if the object or field in question was of a specific type in order to handle
			its display differently. For example, component handles will grab its list of handles (to display its droplist)
			from a different place as resource handles.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, to fix the circular dependency issue, we ended up having rules where each uniquely serialisable object has
			to define how they want to be serialised. From there, the de/serialiser simply ensured that the serialisation
			format was consistent across all files.
		</p>

		<h3 id="Configuration Manager">Configuration Manager</h3>

		<p>
			The configuration manager acted as the manager for all "settings" files. I have come to regret the design
			decision that I went with since it was not the most refined and was born out of my ignorance to what the
			reflection system could have (should have) accomplished.
		</p>

		<p>
			The design for the configuration manager was something that we thought could go two ways:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Type free version that uses a <code>std::variant</code> to serialise and deserialise the supported
				types so that the de/serialisation would be consistent across all config types.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inheritance version, where all configs inherit from a base config class and have a virtual
				function that can be used to serialise and deserialise itself.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The first option gave a clean means to serialisation and deserialisation as any other user could create a
			config without worrying about how they should de/serialise them. The second provided type safety, ensuring
			the users that the data they required would exist.
		</p>

		<p>
			Naturally, properly utilising the reflection system would have given us the best of both worlds as it
			would have guarenteed both, however, since this was made before I properly understood and designed the
			reflection system, I opted to go with first option.
		</p>

		<p>
			This choice created an inconvenience, as the users will then have to manually initialise their type safe
			classes with syntax such as:
		</p>

		<div class="center-align">
			<img class="medium-width" src="assets/gam300/examples - configmanager_syntax.PNG" alt="ConfigManager Syntax">
		</div>

		<p>
			And to be safe, they would have to add many checks, such as:
		</p>

		<div class="center-align">
			<img class="medium-width" src="assets/gam300/examples - configmanager_usecase.PNG" alt="Example use of ConfigManager">
		</div>

		<p>
			And a simple spelling mistake meant that they would not be able to detect the issue as easily as a compile
			error would catch it (and we all know how painful it is to have to sit through a long compile time before
			realising that there was something wrong with the code when we run it).
		</p>

		<h3 id="3D Animations">3D Animations</h3>

		<p>
			There are three parts to this task and it was one of the tasks that caused me the most infuriating griefs
			from this project. For context, I had no experience with 3D modeling or rigging and so a lot of the
			concepts flew over my head and I constantly misunderstood stuff, causing me to take a while to understand.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I only had one week to implement these features, it was a rather stressful week and as I researched more
			into the topic, I quickly realised the impracticality of implementing everything in a week. With the help of
			a few friends, I quickly realised that it was faster to establish the pipeline first and only account for
			the parts absolutely necessary for the engine to read and render the models.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, firstly, I discussed with the artists to find out what software they use, and what files they can output.
			Then, I find out what shaders and effects are supported by the engine. From there, I streamline the process
			to transfer only the necessary information. If there are any parts of the process that is more trouble than
			it is worth to handle (edge cases and the such) then I would create steps or workflow restrictions to help
			the artists ensure they do not include more things than necessary in their files, or that they all follow
			guidlines that makes my life easier.
		</p>

		<p>
			While I ultimately took 2 weeks to complete the task, it was still more feasible then the time it would have
			taken to ensure that I handle all of the cases properly.
		</p>

		<h4 class="accordion">Asset Compiler</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				The first part was to have a way for us to load the resources that the artists have made. However, instead
				of personally accounting and creating multiple format loaders for each file format (not to mention how
				buggy it would be since others would know better than we do), we needed an easier, more reliable way to
				process each asset type.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is where the asset compiler came in. We made use of the library
				<a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">Assimp</a> to do most of the heavy lifting. It was the hub for
				the different asset types to be converted into a single assimp object which we can then use to convert into
				our own singular file format.
			</p>

			<p>
				This was difficult as we needed to properly understand how the nodes in Assimp worked. At times it was
				difficult as some of the terminology overlapped with some of the commonly used 3D modeling tools such
				as Maya. There was also an added complexity to the graphs that Assimp would build as they do not just
				handle models, but the whole scene as well. This meant that there were more information to sift through
				than just a skinned mesh and its animation. It included lights, entity paths, etc. and we needed a way
				to check if a node was truly a bone, or if it was even part of a relevant animation (multiple animations
				could exist in one scene) which is near impossible from <i>just</i> the data that Assimp provides.
			</p>

			<p>
				This forced us to impose rules on the artists when they made their models to ensure that the compiler would
				be able to identify the relevant informations from the files and build the animations proper. However, once
				that was done, it made things a lot easier for us to move forward with.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 class="accordion">Bone Animation</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				This was by far one of the most difficult part of the project that I had to deal with since it involved the
				very thing I was bad at - math. It took me two weeks to implement the Bone Animations and Skinned Mesh
				Renderer because of how long it took for me to understand the hierarchy of bones and nodes, the concept of
				pre and post transformations.
			</p>

			<p>
				It required a lot of research and studying of the available
				<a href="http://ogldev.org/www/tutorial38/tutorial38.html">tutorials</a> and documentations not only online,
				but offline with the help of my peers and lectures who were more knowledgable on the topic.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 class="accordion">Skinned Mesh Renderer</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				For the Skinned Mesh Renderer, I implemented the vertex shader and liased with the team's graphics programmer
				to incorperate the renderer to the graphics system as they were using differred shading, a new technique that
				I was not familiar with. I also referenced Unity for how they handle their skinned mesh renderers to know
				better what kind of features would be expected from it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="Prefab System">Prefab System</h3>

		<p>
			One method of implementing the prefab system is to create entities within the scene that act as the prefab entity
			and simply have the other entities reference the prefab ID to know which prefabs they belong to. That way, when
			the prefab entity is modified, they can find all entities in the scene to update them (only if the modified
			field was not overriden).
		</p>

		<p>
			However, this implementation of the prefab system was more difficult due to the poor design choices that we made
			prior with regards to how the components and entities are implemented. Since it was not fully powered by the
			reflection system (at the time, the reflection system was not fully developed) and not purely data driven, we
			could not just use the entity and component classes to create prefabs.
		</p>

		<p>
			For context, our entity classes had a reference to the scene it belongs to so as to grab other relevant data from
			said scene, and our components hold a reference to its owning entity. This meant that for a component to exist,
			it needed an entity, and for an entity to exist, it needed a scene. Coupled with the fact that we did not have the
			ability to reference objects in other scenes since the handles were only unique within the scene, it meant that we
			were unable to create and edit entities and just treat a scene as a prefab scene to edit from.
		</p>

		<p>
			To solve this, we ended up creating proxies to act as the go between so that the prefabs are treated as resources
			instead. The prefabs have events for each component and fields so that when they are modified, they can invoke all
			the registered listeners to tell them to update their fields accordingly. The entities then register themselves to
			the respective prefab resources at the their creation.
		</p>

		<p>
			The entities also have their own list of overriden fields so when a field is modified, it is marked as overriden
			so when the prefabs are modified, the fields that have been registered as overriden will ignore the update event.
		</p>

		<h3 id="MISC">Miscellaneous</h3>

		<p>
			This section is for other miscellaneous things that I had contributed to the team that is not exactly
			deserving of a full chapter to itself, but are still things that I have either learnt from, or is a
			little interesting (well, at least to me).
		</p>

		<h4 class="accordion">Type</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				The <code>Type</code> class is used to mimic the <code>std::is_base_of</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>
				functionality without the need to use the actual C++ type. If an object tracks it's own registered object ID,
				they can see if the object is a child of a specific type so long as the hierarchy is registered appropriately.
				same functionality as <code>typeid(type_t).hashcode()</code> and <code>typeid(type_t).name()</code>. Ideally,
				it was meant to guarentee consistency across builds unlike typeid which did not have such assurance, and it
				was also meant to be constexpr to reduce the memory and loading costs, but at the time of developing DarkHorse,
				I was unable to figure out how to do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				I eventually figured it out for my personal project and so you can refer to my new 
				<a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/Chilldew/blob/master/Utility/source/Utility/cdu_type.h">implementation</a>
				in my <a href="https://github.com/XxGTSCxX/Chilldew">Chilldew project</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the new implementation, I was able to figure out how to make the functions constexpr and have more guarenteed
				consistency in the generation of the type identifier so that it is the same across builds and runs to help
				facilitate the de/serialisation and reflection system.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 class="accordion">Singleton</h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				While I understand that there are some debates on the use of singletons (lord knows how many
				times I've had this conversation with my brother), I do believe that there is a time and a place
				for them, and knowing when to use them comes with experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				So here's a comparison on the implementation of the general Singleton class I had created from the
				beginning compared to where I stand on it now.
			</p>

			<div class="row">

				<div class="column" style="width: 50%">
					<h5>BEFORE</h5>
					<img src="assets/gam300/examples - singleton_old.PNG" alt="Singleton - Before">
				</div>

				<div class="column" style="width: 50%">
					<h5>AFTER</h5>
					<img src="assets/gam300/examples - singleton_new.PNG" alt="Singleton - After">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				As you could probably tell, I fell for the mistake of having the object be a static variable. This
				meant that we no longer had the control of when the object is instantiated or destroyed, causing
				cases where an undefined behaviour could occur.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second version gave the user the ability to not only control when the object is instantiated,
				but the ability to check if an instance exists before using it. Meaning that there was more control
				and less undefined behaviour.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4 class="accordion">Flags</code></h4>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>
				Frankly speaking, I made this back in the <a href="project - dynamo.html">Dynamo project</a> but at
				the time, nobody aside from me used it (;_;) and there were some things that I did not handle properly.
				So, for this project, I ported it, fixed it up, and then a teammate realised its existance and so it started
				getting used by people other than me (thanks Chris ;_;).</iframe>
			</p>

			<p>
				So, what's this? Basically it's like <code>std::bitset</code> but for enums and enum classes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Enums are useful for defining a group of flags that you might have for a specific use case so that
				people know what flags are relavent to their variable. However, while enums afford you the convinience
				of performing bitwise operations on the values without the hassle of casting to the underlying type or
				defining the bitwise operators for every enum class you have, it loses the type safety that enum
				classes provide (which is why enum classes are generally more preferred over enums). On the otherhand,
				enum classes give you type safety in exchange for the inconvenience.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, in general, manually doing the bitwise operations to turn a flag on or off can also be an easy
				way to introduce bugs into your program (it's easy for you or your friends to, in your sleep deprived
				3AM state, do <code>flag_obj &= FLAG</code> in an attempt to turn your flag off instead of
				<code>flag_obj &= ~FLAG</code> <s>*cough*Imightbespeakingfromexperience*cough*</s>).
			</p>

			<p>
				What the <code>Flags</code> class does, is allow you to use enum classes for type safety but remove the
				inconvenience by handling all the bitwise operator definitions, and provide a proper interface for the
				user to turn their flags on or off, or check if their flags are on or off.
			</p>

			<p>
				So instead of doing <code>flag_obj &= ~FLAG</code>, you have more readability with
				<code>flag_obj.Off(FLAG)</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Putting the implementation in the <code>Flags</code> class also allows us to ensure that the enum defines
				an all-flags-on value. This helps facilitates us to check if all flags of a specific value is on or off
				when dealing with multiple flag checks.
			</p>
